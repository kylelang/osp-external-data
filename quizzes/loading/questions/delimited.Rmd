Answerlist
----------

* CORRECT: `read_delim()` is the correct **tidyverse** function. Here, we use suitable default options.
* CORRECT: `read_delim()` is the correct **tidyverse** function. Here, we specify the space character as the delimiter.
* CORRECT: `read.table()` is the correct Base R function. Here, we specify the space character as the delimiter.
* CORRECT: `read.table()` is the correct Base R function.
* INCORRECT: The delimiter is the space character, not the tab character.
* INCORRECT: To specify the delimiter in `read_delim()` the correct argument is `delim`, not `sep`.
* INCORRECT: The delimiter in the file is the space, not the tab.
* INCORRECT: The function `read_tsv()` is for reading tab-delimited files.
* INCORRECT: The file path is wrong.
* INCORRECT: The file path is wrong.
* INCORRECT: The file path is wrong.
