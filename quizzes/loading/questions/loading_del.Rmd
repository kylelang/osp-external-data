Question
========
Which of the following expressions will read the file `info.dat`, that is inside the directory `data`? Consider that `info.dat` is space-delimited file and assume that all the necessary packages are already loaded.

Answerlist
----------
* `read_delim("data/info.dat")`
* `read_delim("data/info.dat", delim = " ")`
* `read.table("data/info.dat", header = TRUE, sep= " ")`
* `read.table("data/info.dat", header = TRUE)`
* `read_delim("data/info.dat", delim = "\t")`
* `read_delim("data/info.dat", sep= " ")`
* `read.table("data/info.dat", sep= "\t")`
* `read_tsv("data/info.dat", delim = " ")`
* `read_delim("info.dat")`
* `read_delim("info.dat", delim = " ")`
* `read.table("info.dat", header = TRUE, sep= " ")`

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* TRUE: `read_delim()` is the function that reads space-delimited files from the package `readr`
* TRUE: `read_delim()` is the function that reads space-delimited files from the package `readr` and we specify the space as the delimiter
* TRUE: `read.table()` is the function that reads space-delimited files from base R and we specify the space as the separator
* TRUE: `read.table()` is the function that reads space-delimited files from base R
* FALSE: The delimiter in the file is the space, not the tab 
* FALSE: To specify the delimiter in `read_delim()` the correct argument is `delim`, not `sep`
* FALSE: The delimiter in the file is the space, not the tab 
* FALSE: The function `read_tsv()` doesn't have the argument `delim`
* FALSE: The file is in the directory data
* FALSE: The file is in the directory data
* FALSE: The file is in the directory data
