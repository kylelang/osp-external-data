Question
========

Witch of the following expressions will save the data frame `girls` as a single R object and not a workspace file, and be sure to retain the object name. Assume that all the needed packages are already loaded.

Answerlist
----------

* It is not possible to save a R object as a .rds file while retaining its name
* `saveRDS(girls,  "girls.rds")`
* `saveRDS(girls, retain = TRUE, "girls.rds")`
* `saveRDS(girls,  "girls.RData")`
* `save(girls,  "girls.RData")`
* `save(girls,  "girls.rds")`
* `write_RDS(girls,  "girls.rds")`
* `write_RDS(girls, retain = TRUE, "girls.rds")`
