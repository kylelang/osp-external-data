title: "Loading Data"
---

Before any data analysis can begin, the data itself must be loaded into the R environment. This step, often referred to as data import, is fundamental to any workflow. Data arrives in many forms—some structured and clean, others less so—and from a wide variety of sources. Each format requires its own strategy for reading and interpretation.

In the sections that follow, we explore the most commonly encountered data formats and the tools used to load them. We begin with plain-text tabular files—CSV, TSV, and space-delimited data—using functions from the `readr` package, which provides fast and consistent methods for reading structured text data. 

We then turn to data stored in non-delimited formats. This includes R’s native binary files (.RData and .rds), as well as datasets from SPSS (another statistical software) or Excel. To work with these, we make use of additional packages including `haven`, `labelled`, `readxl`, and `openxlsx`.
